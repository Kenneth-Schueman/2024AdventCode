# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! 🎄✨

## About
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding challenge that runs every December, providing a series of puzzles that are both fun and thought-provoking. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released, offering a fantastic way to sharpen programming skills during the holiday season.

This repository contains my solutions for the 2024 challenges. My aim is to complete as many puzzles as possible while experimenting with different approaches and learning new techniques along the way.

---

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── day01/
│   └── solution.py    # My solution for Day 1
├── day02/
│   └── solution.py    # My solution for Day 2
├── day03/
│   └── solution.py    # My solution for Day 2
├── ...
├── README.md          # This file
└── utils/             # Utility scripts (e.g., common helpers for input parsing)
```

Each folder corresponds to a specific day, containing:
- **`input.txt`**: The input data for the puzzle. (*Optional)
- **`solution.py`**: The Python script implementing my solution.

---

## Tools & Languages
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: 
  - `itertools`
  - `math`
  - `re` (regular expressions)
  - Additional libraries as needed per puzzle.

---

## Running Solutions
To run a solution for a specific day:

1. Navigate to the corresponding directory:
   ```bash
   cd dayXX
   ```
2. Run the solution script:
   ```bash
   python solution.py
   ```

Ensure the `input.txt` file is in the same directory as the script.
